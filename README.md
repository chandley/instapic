Instagram Challenge
===================

Week 8 build Instagram using Rails. 

You'll need users who can post pictures, write comments on pictures and like a picture. It will need to look like the instagrams website or better. 

Breakdown of models:
- User
- Post
- Comment/description
- Like

Bonus if you can add filters :P

==Technology

Set up a rails application using Devise and Paperclip

Introduced Cucumber to rails environment
Used Cucumber as TDD - write test before introducing feature

==Lessons learned
Important to keep Integration Cucumber tests high level
Web steps in cucumber seem to make it easier to keep track of test setup (perhaps slower than rspec?)
